### Acknowledgments

Thanks for @AdrianoEscarabote for helping me shorten the JavaScript code, i learned a lot!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://druevisual.github.io/interactive-rating-component-main/

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML Attributes
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is still a newbie project so the html and css part is pretty simple. I learned how to use custom attributes and manipulate it with javascript.

### Continued development

I need to work on my javascript knowledge. The main problem is that i don't see the structure of the language. Sometimes where i think it should be a semicolon there isn't, when or where to use the different type of brackets. I also need to work on responsiveness.
